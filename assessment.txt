Rails Assesment

The answers to this assesment should be submitted in the form of a link to a github repo
The repository should be a rails app with one additional file in the root directory called assesment.txt

Create a blog.

The blog should have the ability to have posts and comments on posts.  There's no need to add a user model.

From any post I should be able to both see all the comments and add a comment myself.

Questions to be answered in the assesment.txt file.
